1. Write a program (function!) that takes a list and returns a new list that
contains all the elements of the first list minus all the duplicates.

2. Write a program (using functions!) that asks the user for a long string
containing multiple words. Print back to the user the same string,
except with the words in backwards order. For example, say I type the string:

input: My name is Michele
Then I would see the string:

output: Michele is name My
shown back to me.
